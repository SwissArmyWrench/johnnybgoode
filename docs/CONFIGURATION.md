# Configuring johnnybgoode

## configuration.yaml

### Mandatory values

`johnnydecimal_home`: The path to the top folder of your JohnnyDecimal tree
`name_scheme`: either DACID or ACID. Currently, this value is not read by johnnybgoode as it has been hard-coded to work with DACID during development thus far. Support for ACID is coming soon.
